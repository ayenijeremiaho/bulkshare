# A Project For Bulk Sharing 

This Project aims to:

1. Create a `Wholesaler API` where wholesalers can upload & view engagement on their products
2. Create a `General User API` where end users can create a share-group, engage themselves, the wholesalers and their products
3. Create an `Admin/Reporting API` where admin can make changes, verify wholesalers, and decisions based on the engagements on the portals
4. Ultimately, `Bulk Share` is a platform where `Divisible Bulk Items` are sold, but payment is shared among a group of users called `share group`.
